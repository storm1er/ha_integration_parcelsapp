# ParcelsApp Integration for Home Assistant

A Home Assistant integration for [ParcelsApp.com](https://parcelsapp.com/), a universal parcel tracking service.

## Features

### Binary Sensor

| Sensor             | Description                                             |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Parcels App Status | Monitors the availability of the ParcelsApp.com website |

### Button

| Button                      | Description                                                    |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Update Parcels App Tracking | Updates all parcels not marked as delivered or archived        |

### Services

The integration provides the following services:

#### `parcelsapp.track_package`

- **Arguments:**
  - `tracking_id` (Required): The parcel's tracking ID provided by your parcel/delivery company.
  - `name` (Optional): An optional name for your parcel (used as the sensor name).
  - `zipcode` (Optional): The destination zip/postal code for more accurate tracking.

#### `parcelsapp.remove_package`

- **Arguments:**
  - `tracking_id` (Required): The tracking ID of the package you wish to stop tracking.

Use the `parcelsapp.remove_package` service to remove a package from tracking. This will delete the associated sensor and stop any further updates for that package.

#### `parcelsapp.prune_packages`

- **Arguments:** None

Use the `parcelsapp.prune_packages` service to automatically remove packages that haven't been updated in over 2 months. This helps keep your tracked packages list clean by removing old, inactive tracking entries.

### Tracking Sensor

The `track_package` service creates a sensor for each tracked package with the following attributes:

| Attribute       | Description                                                        |

## Installation

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=storm1er&repository=ha_integration_parcelsapp&category=Integration)

1. Add this GitHub repository to HACS as a custom repository, or click the badge above.
2. Install the "Parcels App" integration via HACS.
3. Restart Home Assistant.
4. Add the integration via the Home Assistant UI (Configuration > Integrations > Add Integration > Parcels App).

## Configuration

During setup, you'll need to provide:

1. Your ParcelsApp API key (obtainable from [parcelsapp.com/dashboard](https://parcelsapp.com/dashboard))
